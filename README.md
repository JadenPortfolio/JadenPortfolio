-  Hi, I’m @JadenPortfolio. I have a beginner level understanding of coding and a basic understanding of Python.
-  My interests are reading, gaming, food, and coding. My favorite book is The Vanishing Half by Britt Bennett.
      For Gaming, I recently got into the Final Fantasy Series and I love it.
      Food because I'm from the Southern United States, so I love a good home cooked meal.
      Finally, coding is a new passion of mine since I've gotten to college and I'm really hoping to get better.
-  I’m currently studying Computer Science in college.
-  You can reach me here on Github, follow me on instagram @UMJJaden, and contact me by email(request).
